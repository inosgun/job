# Introduction

## Welcome to the Wormhole xDapp Book!

This guide aims to help you in your journey as a cross-chain developer by explaining the core concepts of Wormhole and xDapp development.

We'll start by outlining the most important aspects of Wormhole and the considerations which must be taken when developing an xDapp. After that, the second portion of the book helps you set up a development environment and get started writing actual code. By the end of this guide, you should be ready to build and deploy your first xDapp.

While this document doesn't assume you have experience with any particular technologies, a general understanding of blockchain development will help you get up to speed.
